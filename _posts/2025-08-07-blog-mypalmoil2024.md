## Production Trends: A Story of Recovery

### CPO Production Recovery (2016â€“2024)

```
Year    Production (Million Tonnes)    Change
2016         17.32                    -13.2%
2017         19.92                    +15.0%
2018         19.52                     -2.0%
2019         19.86                     +1.8%
2020         19.14                     -3.6%
2021         18.12                     -5.4%
2022         18.45                     +1.9%
2023         18.55                     +0.5%
2024         19.34                     +4.2%
```

The industry experienced significant volatility, with the El NiÃ±o phenomenon causing a sharp 13.2% decline in 2016, followed by a strong recovery in 2017. The 2020â€“2021 period saw consecutive declines primarily due to labor shortages, with a critical shortage of 75,000 harvesters leading to 20â€“30% drops in potential FFB production.

---

## The Labor Challenge: Industry's Achilles' Heel

**Labor availability has emerged as the single most critical factor affecting production:**

* **2021 Crisis**: 75,000 harvester shortage led to 5.4% production decline
* **2023â€“2024 Recovery**: Improved labor supply drove consecutive production increases
* **Current Status**: FFB yield at 16.70 t/ha still below pre-pandemic standard of 20.0 t/ha

The industry's heavy reliance on manual harvesting makes it particularly vulnerable to labor market disruptions, highlighting the urgent need for mechanization and workforce development initiatives.

---

## Weather Impact: Climate as a Production Wildcard

Weather conditions significantly influence both production volume and quality:

### Oil Extraction Rate (OER) Variations

* **2022**: 19.70% (lowest in two decades due to poor FFB quality)
* **2023**: 19.86% (+0.8% improvement)
* **2024**: 19.67% (âˆ’1.0% decline due to heavy rainfall and flooding)

Adverse weather affects the proportion of ripe, high-quality FFB processed, with impacts potentially delayed by up to 12 months, complicating market forecasting.

---

## Price Dynamics: Global Markets Drive Local Fortunes

### CPO Price Volatility (2022â€“2025)

Malaysian CPO prices demonstrate high sensitivity to global market conditions:

* **2022**: Record high annual average of RM 5,087.50/tonne
* **2023**: Sharp 25.1% decline to RM 3,809.50/tonne
* **2024**: Partial recovery to RM 4,179.50/tonne
* **2025 (Janâ€“July)**: Fluctuating between RM 3,880â€“4,759/tonne

### Key Price Drivers:

1. **Global Competition**: Soybean and sunflower oil price relationships
2. **Geopolitical Events**: Russiaâ€“Ukraine war impact and Indonesiaâ€™s export policies
3. **Import Policies**: Major buyers like India and China adjusting procurement
4. **Inventory Levels**: 18-month high stocks in June 2024 pressured prices
5. **Government Policies**: Export duty adjustments (currently 9% for August 2025)

---

## FFBâ€“CPO Price Correlation: Upstreamâ€“Downstream Linkage

FFB prices closely mirror CPO market movements, with the 2023 experience illustrating this strong correlation:

* **CPO prices**: âˆ’25.1% decline
* **FFB (Mill Gate) prices**: âˆ’28.4% decline

This tight relationship means global market volatility directly impacts smallholder farmers' incomes, emphasizing the need for price stabilization mechanisms.

## Market Structure: Price-Taker in Global Commodity Complex

Malaysia operates as a **price-taker** in the global vegetable oils market, where external factors often override domestic supplyâ€“demand dynamics:

### External Influence Hierarchy:

1. Global vegetable oil supplyâ€“demand balance
2. Competing oil prices (soybean, sunflower)
3. Major producer policies (Indonesiaâ€™s export bans)
4. Geopolitical events and trade tensions
5. Biodiesel mandates and renewable energy policies

---

## Future Outlook: Cautious Optimism with Strategic Shifts

### Production Forecast

* **2025 Projection**: 19.5 million tonnes (+1.0% from 2024)
* **Key Assumption**: Continued improvement in labor supply

### Strategic Initiatives

1. **Sustainability Focus**: MSPO certification expansion
2. **EU Market Adaptation**: Preparing for EUDR compliance
3. **Value Addition**: R\&D in high-value palm-based products
4. **Climate Resilience**: Infrastructure and adaptive farming techniques

### Recent Challenges (Late 2024 / Early 2025)

* **Flooding Impact**: January 2025 production dropped 16.8% to 1.24 million tonnes
* **Seasonal Patterns**: Novemberâ€“December 2024 showed typical end-year decline
* **Weather Volatility**: Continued impact on harvesting and transportation

## Conclusion

Malaysiaâ€™s palm oil industry stands at a crossroads, showing resilience through recent recovery while facing persistent structural challenges. The path forward requires balanced attention to immediate concernsâ€”labor availability and weather resilienceâ€”while building long-term competitive advantages through sustainability, mechanization, and value addition.

Success in the global market will depend on the industryâ€™s ability to transform from a commodity price-taker to a differentiated, sustainable supplier of palm-based products, ensuring both economic viability and environmental responsibility in an increasingly demanding global marketplace.
