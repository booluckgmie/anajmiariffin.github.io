The modern workplace is more complex than ever. Layoffs no longer just impact those who leave

Layoffs are a jarring reality for any organization. But while the focus is often on those who leave, what about the silent majority who stay behind? The experience of surviving a layoff has changed dramatically, especially with the rise of AI and automation. What was once about a frozen salary and heavier workload has become a complex web of anxiety, competition with machines, and a deep-seated change in workplace culture.

### The New Layoff Reality: Competing with Algorithms
In 2011, layoffs were primarily a cost-cutting measure. Today, they are often linked to a company's push for efficiency through artificial intelligence. Employees who stay are now asked to learn new systems and, in a profound irony, train the very AI tools that could one day replace their jobs. This creates a psychological tension that is entirely new. The question is no longer just "am I productive enough?" but "am I better than the machine that is learning from me?"

This dynamic fundamentally alters the concept of job security. The measure of success is shifting from how much you do to how well your work compares to an algorithm. It's a pressure that weighs heavily on the "survivors," leaving them feeling less secure and more like they are in a constant state of proving their value.

The fear that follows a layoff is a powerful motivator for cautious behavior. When employees are constantly worried about the next round of cuts, they are less likely to innovate, speak up, or take risks. This state of constant anxiety can lead to a culture of disengagement and silence, where survival, not growth, becomes the primary goal.

Beyond individual anxiety, layoffs leave deep cultural scars. Psychologists call it "survivor's guilt," a sense of unease and self-questioning about why they were spared when others were not. This is amplified by social media, where former colleagues announce their job losses, keeping the uncertainty front and center for everyone. The organization's culture becomes quieter, less confident, and less willing to give the extra effort, making rebuilding trust a long and difficult process.

The financial impact of layoffs isn't limited to those who are let go. Employees who remain often face frozen wages, a lack of opportunities for promotion, and bonuses that vanish. For many, this puts a significant strain on their personal finances, from retirement savings to daily living expenses. When hard work is not financially rewarded, motivation plummets, and the workplace becomes a place of survival rather than growth.

The social fabric of the workplace also frays. With fewer colleagues, there are fewer opportunities for casual conversation, informal mentoring, and spontaneous collaboration. This can lead to a sense of loneliness, especially in hybrid or remote work environments, where the connections that help people navigate change might already be weakened.

### The Malaysian Perspective
While the global trends are clear, how does this play out in Malaysia and the broader Asian region?
 * Malaysia: The Malaysian labor market has shown resilience, with a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.1% in January 2025, a near decade-low. This indicates a robust labor market overall. However, layoffs still happen, with almost 300,000 workers losing their jobs between 2020 and September 2024. The manufacturing sector recorded the highest number of layoffs, followed by wholesale, retail, and information and communication technology. The government has introduced initiatives like the Employment Insurance System (EIS) and HRD Corp to provide financial aid and reskilling opportunities for those who lose their jobs.
 * Asia: Layoffs in Asia have been significant, particularly in the tech sector. Since the start of 2025, nearly 29,000 workers in India, Southeast Asia, and China combined have been retrenched. India, in particular, has seen the most layoffs in the region since 2021. In Indonesia, for example, the first half of 2025 saw a 32.1% jump in layoffs compared to the same period in 2024, concentrated in manufacturing, retail, and mining.
 * Global: Globally, the tech sector has been hit particularly hard. Over 260,000 tech jobs were slashed globally in 2024, with companies like Intel, Dell, and Amazon leading the cuts. The trend of AI-driven layoffs is accelerating, with companies like Salesforce replacing customer service roles with AI agents, leading to thousands of job cuts. A Malaysian minister projected that over 30% of jobs in the country will be affected by AI in the next decade, with key sectors like manufacturing, services, and IT undergoing significant transformation.

The modern workplace is more complex than ever. Layoffs no longer just impact those who leave; they leave a lasting impression on the survivors. Understanding these hidden costs and addressing them with transparency, empathy, and a commitment to employee development is crucial for leaders who want to rebuild trust and ensure their organizations can thrive, not just survive, in the age of AI.
