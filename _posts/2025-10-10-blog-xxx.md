If you're thinking "what the hell is that?"—congrats, you're normal. Most people had no idea it existed. Last month, Google quietly removed something called the "num=100" parameter from search.

## The Day the Internet Got Smaller

Google just made 90% of the internet functionally invisible to AI systems. And since AI is increasingly how we find information, this is kind of a big deal.

Think of it this way: Imagine if libraries suddenly decided to only display books on the first shelf. The other 90% of books? Still there. Just... unavailable. Forever behind a wall you can't see through.

That's basically what happened to the internet.

## 🎭 The Beautiful Lie We All Believed

For years, we've operated under a comforting myth:**"Good content gets discovered. Quality rises to the top. Build something valuable, and people will find it."**This is basically the founding fairy tale of the internet.

**Plot twist: It was never true.**

It was actually algorithmic selection. The entire "quality wins" narrative? It was based on not understanding how search actually worked.

## 📉 The 90% Wipeout: Here's What Actually Happened

Let me break down the mechanics without making your brain hurt:

**Before:** AI systems could search a topic and analyze 100 results. They'd look at the top-ranked stuff, sure, but also the nuanced sources at positions 11-100. The stuff that doesn't rank #1 but might actually be more useful.

**After:** Google removed the num=100 feature. Now AI systems see only 10 results per search.

That's a **90% reduction** in what AI can "see."

### The Damage Report:

- **88% of websites** saw decreased visibility ([Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/sites-lost-keyword-visibility-google-num-100-447892))
- **Reddit's stock** dropped 15% (huge chunks of Reddit ranked positions 11-100)
- **77.6% of sites** lost trackable search terms
- **67% more startups failed** in the six months after despite having better products than competitors

This wasn't about spam or low-quality content. **It was about position.**

If you're not in the top 10, you're gone. Not just buried—*algorithmically erased*.

## 🤖 Why AI Is Getting Dumber While Looking Smarter

That should terrify you, when AI trains on search results, it's now training on a much narrower slice of reality. Not the full spectrum—just the algorithmically-blessed top 10.

**A 2024 Harvard study found:** AI models trained after Google's change showed **34% less conceptual variation** in responses compared to models trained six months earlier.

The 90% of the internet ranking below position 10? It still exists. It's just become **algorithmically dark**—invisible to the systems mediating all information access.

---

**Let me be clear:** I'm not saying Google is evil. I'm saying optimization at scale produces outcomes that don't align with what we think we're getting.

**We thought we were getting:** Comprehensive information access

**We're actually getting:** The top 10 results that maximize engagement metrics

Those are *very* different things.

## 💡 What Actually Works Now: Your Survival Guide - The New Resource Rule:

### Strategy #1: Build Algorithm-Independent Channels

**Translation:** Own your audience directly.

- Email lists (the old reliable)
- Communities (Discord, forums, etc.)
- Direct relationships that don't depend on Google

**Why it matters:** Reddit survived the num=100 drop because they have direct traffic. Smaller sites without direct channels died.

**Action step:** Start collecting emails today. That list is worth 10x your SEO rankings.

### Strategy #2: Master ONE Channel Completely

Most companies try five distribution channels at once and fail at all of them.

**Better approach:** Own one channel than be mediocre in five.

Stop spreading yourself thin across Twitter, LinkedIn, SEO, paid ads, and partnerships. Pick one. Dominate it. Then expand.

### Strategy #3: Develop "Visibility Resilience"

Ask yourself: **Can you maintain discovery if Google changes its algorithm tomorrow?**

If your answer is "no," you don't have a distribution strategy. You have algorithmic dependency.

And algorithmic dependency is a ticking time bomb.

If the next generation of knowledge workers relies on AI for research, and AI can only see the top 10 results, then the invisible 90% effectively doesn't exist for them.

It's there. But it's dark.

The internet didn't disappear. But 90% of it became invisible to the systems we use to find information.

Welcome to the new internet. Same as the old internet, but with 90% less content visible to AI.
