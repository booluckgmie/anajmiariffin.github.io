The MySPC project is about Malaysia Social Protection Council, which aims to provide social protection for citizens through various measures to address economic, social, and environmental risks, ensuring their well-being throughout their lives. The social protection structure is organized around four main elements: protection, prevention, promotion, and transformation. The social protection in Malaysia is divided into three main tiers: Social Assistance, Social Insurance, and Labor Market Intervention.
