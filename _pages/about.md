<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Neehaw! Selamat datang! My name is Najmi, graduated from the University of Malaya (UM) with a Master’s in Applied Statistics.I hold a Master’s in Applied Statistics from the University of Malaya (UM) and am currently pursuing a PhD in Health Economics at the National University of Malaysia (UKM), Kuala Lumpur. My research focuses on integrating data science, government policy, and healthcare activities through the application of GIS technology.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I began my career in 2011 at the University of Malaya (UM), where I took on research and administrative roles. As a Research Assistant (Sep 2011 – Feb 2012), I assisted in data collection for a study on dental prosthetics, contributing to an ISI-indexed publication on the marginal fit of monolithic ceramic crowns. I then progressed to a Project Officer role (Aug 2011 – Feb 2019), where I coordinated dental research activities, including training, seminars, conferences, and workshops. I was also responsible for research dissemination, managing faculty websites and social media, and tracking research achievements.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2019, I joined the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) as a Statistician. Within my forte, the current research is focused on integrating studies of the data science fields, government policy and healthcare activities through application of GIS technology. With 5 years experiences in big data, I works closely with Core Team Big Data Analytics at DOSM on establishing informal sector national database with the collaboration of several government agencies and modernising data on Big Data Analytics project. </p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In July 2024, I joined PETRONAS as an Executive (Industry Advisory), leveraging my expertise in data science and analytics to drive innovation and efficiency within the industry. My role involves analyzing the OGSE landscape, gathering market intelligence, and providing strategic insights. I also facilitate cross-functional collaboration to enhance internal synergies across the organization. By integrating data analytics with strategic industry analysis, I contribute to strengthening PETRONAS’ industry advisory capabilities, supporting informed decision-making and improving operational efficiency.</p>
